Compound Poisson Process (CPP) Explorer 🧪: An R Shiny app simulating $S(t) = \sum X_i$ where arrivals are $\text{Poisson}(\lambda)$ and jump sizes are $\text{Exponential}(\mu)$. Interact with $\lambda$ and $\mu$ to analyze the process path and its terminal distribution. Great for visualizing risk modeling and the Central Limit Theorem.
